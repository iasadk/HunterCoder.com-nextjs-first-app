    "title": "Why Next.js is so popular framework of 2022",
    "desc": "One of the top benefits of learning what is Next.js, is the knowledge of how flexible you can become in building, and adapting to online reality. Internally as the provider of React js development services, we think it’s the single most important advantage in a hyper-growing digital world, as we can quickly try and test our ideas. If we succeed, we can easily add new features and react to rapid changes much faster than ever before to stay competitive. If not, it’s easier to rebuild the entire strategy and adapt accordingly. Another thing is the way we buy today. That also went crazy. We became much more demanding when it comes to page loading speed (in milliseconds!) and the user experience from using websites or web shops. That creates a perfect opportunity for companies that decided to trust modern technologies, like React.js, or have chosen the way of the Jamstack approach. It allows you to build both simple and complex web applications much faster, easier, and thanks to many great frameworks that have grown upon it, you can now build blazingly fast websites to achieve a much better UX and SEO efficiency. Let’s have a look at one of those frameworks – Next.js, which enjoys growing popularity and quickly became the first choice for many big names and companies.",
